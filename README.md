## 1. Introducing Image Processing and scikit-image
Jump into digital image structures and learn to process them! Extract data, transform and analyze images using NumPy and Scikit-image. With just a few lines of code, you will convert RGB images to grayscale, get data from them, obtain histograms containing very useful information, and separate objects from the background!

## 2. Filters, Contrast, Transformation and Morphology
You will learn to detect object shapes using edge detection filters, **improve medical images with contrast enhancement and even enlarge pictures to five times its original size!** You will also apply morphology to make thresholding more accurate when segmenting images and go to the next level of processing images with Python.

## 3. Image restoration, Noise, Segmentation and Contours
So far, you have done some very cool things with your image processing skills! In this chapter, you will apply **image restoration to remove objects, logos, text, or damaged areas** in pictures! You will also learn how to apply noise, use segmentation to speed up processing, and find elements in images by their contours.

## 4. Advanced Operations, Detecting Faces and Features
After completing this chapter, you will have a deeper knowledge of image processing as you will be able to **detect edges, corners, and even faces!** You will learn how to detect not just front faces but also face profiles, cat, or dogs. You will apply your skills to more **complex real-world applications**. Learn to master several widely used image processing techniques with very few lines of code!
